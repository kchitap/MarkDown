## The Champions

League of legends is a popular multiplayer online battle arena game. The game has several competitive game modes which all use a set of playable characters called "champions". Each champion has a different skillset and range of abilities used to help the team win the game. Their unique characteristics set them apart from one another, and are part of the reason for the large following they recieve. In addition to these in game differences though, each champion has a biographical history, which relates to the lore of the game. Both are important in understanding the champion and the game as a whole.
